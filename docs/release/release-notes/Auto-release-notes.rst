Auto Release Notes
==================

This document provides the release notes for Fraser release of Auto.


Important notes
===============

Initial release (project inception: July 2017).


Summary
=======

OPNFV is a SDNFV system integration project for open-source components, which so far have been mostly limited to the NFVI+VIM as generally described by ETSI.

In particular, OPNFV has yet to integrate higher-level automation features for VNFs and end-to-end Services.

Auto ("ONAP-Automated OPNFV") will focus on ONAP component integration and verification with OPNFV reference platforms/scenarios, through primarily a post-install process in order to avoid impact to OPNFV installer projects. As much as possible, this will use a generic installation/integration process (not specific to any OPNFV installer's technology).
* `ONAP <https://www.onap.org/`_, a Linux Foundation Project, is an open source software platform that delivers robust capabilities for the design, creation, orchestration, monitoring, and life cycle management of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). 

While all of ONAP is in scope, as it proceeds, the project will focus on specific aspects of this integration and verification in each release. Some example topics and work items include:

* How ONAP meets VNFM standards, and interacts with VNFs from different vendors
* How ONAP SDN-C uses OPNFV existing features, e.g. NetReady, in a two-layer controller architecture in which the upper layer (global controller) is replaceable, and the lower layer can use different vendor’s local controller to interact with SDN-C
* What data collection interface VNF and controllers provide to ONAP DCAE, and (through DCAE), to closed-loop control functions such as Policy
Tests which verify interoperability of ONAP automation/lifecycle features with specific NFVI and VIM features, as prioritized by the project with technical community and EUAG input. Examples include:

  * Abstraction of networking tech/features e.g. through NetReady/Gluon
  * Blueprint-based VNF deployment (HOT, TOSCA, YANG)
  * Application level configuration and lifecycle through YANG (for any aspects depending upon OPNFV NFVI+VIM components)
  * Policy (through DCAE)
  * Telemetry (through VES/DCAE)

Initial areas of focus for Auto (in orange dotted lines; this scope can be expanded for future releases)
It is understood that:
* ONAP scope extends beyond the lines drawn below
* ONAP architecture does not necessarily align with the ETSI NFV inspired diagrams this is based upon

Testability:
* Tests will be developed for use cases within the project scope.
* In future releases, tests will be added to Functest runs for supporting scenarios.

Auto’s goals include the standup and tests for integrated ONAP-Cloud platforms (“Cloud” here being OPNFV “scenarios” or other cloud environments). Thus, the artifacts would be tools to deploy ONAP (leveraging OOM whenever possible (starting with Beijing release of ONAP), and a preference for the containerized version of ONAP), to integrate it with clouds, to onboard and deploy test VNFs, to configure policies and closed-loop controls, and to run use-case defined tests against that integrated environment. OPNFV scenarios would be a possible component in the above.

Auto currently defines three use cases: Edge Cloud, Resiliency Improvements, and Enterprise vCPE. These use cases aim to show:
* increased autonomy of Edge Cloud management (automation, catalog-based deployment)
* increased resilience (i.e. fast VNF recovery in case of failure or problem, thanks to closed-loop control)
* enterprise-grade performance of vCPEs (certification during onboarding, then real-time performance assurance with SLAs and HA).

The use cases define test cases, which initially will be independent, but which might eventually be integrated to FuncTest.

Additional use cases can be added in the future, such as vIMS (example: project Clearwater). 

Target architectures include x86 and Arm.

An ONAP instance (without DCAE) has been installed over Kubernetes on bare metal on an x86 pod of 6 servers at UNH IOL. 
Onboarding of 2 VNFs is in progress: a vCPE and a vFW.

Integration with Arm servers has started (exploring binary compatibility):
* Openstack is currently installed on a 6-server pod of Arm servers
* a Kubernetes cluster is installed there as well, for another instance of ONAP on Arm servers
* An additional set of 14 Arm servers is in the process of being deployed at UNH, for increased capacity

Test case implementation for the three use cases has started.
